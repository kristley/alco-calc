# AlcoCalc - gr2245
## Release 3

### Intro

This is the third release of AlcoCalc. It is an app created with React Native and Expo. The app lets you log your drinks and will calculate your blood alcohol content (BAC) based on the drinks you have logged, how long you have been drinking for, and the total volume of pure alcohol you have consumed.

Like in the previous releases, you are able to log drinks and see your BAC. The difference is that this release has a new design and is meant to be more user friendly. Like before you can add specify exactly what you have drunk and how much. You can also make what we call prefabs which are drinks that you drink often. The application will remember the drink and you can fill in the fields for a drink with just one click. You can also delete drinks from the log and prefabs from the prefabs list. 

You can easily see logs for previous days and navigate between them. You can also see how long you were drinking for and how much pure alcohol you consumed for these days.
